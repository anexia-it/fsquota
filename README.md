fsquota is a native Go library for interacting with (Linux) filesystem quotas. This library does **not** make use of cgo
or invoke external commands, but rather interacts directly with the kernel interface by use of syscalls. This library is
maintained by the [Anexia](https://www.anexia-it.com/) R&D team.

## Portability

fsquota has been developed with Linux in mind and as such only supports Linux for now. Support for other platforms may
be added in the future.

## fsqm

This repository also ships *fsqm*, a simple command line interface to filesystem quotas. *fsqm* provides the ability to
retrieve user and group quota reports and management of user and group quotas.

*fsqm* can be obtained from [the releases page](https://github.com/anexia-it/fsquota/releases).
